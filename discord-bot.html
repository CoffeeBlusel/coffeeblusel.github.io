                            <p>White Bat is a private bot and may not be added to other servers without explicit request and permission. By allowing the bot to be added to another server, you agree to the Terms of Service and confirm that you have been informed of those Terms.</p>

                            <p>Users must comply with <a href="https://discord.com/terms">Discord’s Terms of Service</a> and <a href="https://discord.com/guidelines">Discord’s Community Guidelines</a> when using White Bat. In the event of a violation involving the bot, the server owner or administrators will be notified and given an opportunity to correct the issue. Failure to do so may result in the bot being removed from the server</p>
                            
                            <p>Server owners and administrators are responsible for inviting the bot and configuring its permissions. By inviting the bot, administrators grant the bot the necessary permissions to perform its intended functions.</p>
